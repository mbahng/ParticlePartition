hi ,

I am consistently seeing a strange behavior on fermicloud

I have a program reading and processing text files - it runs for about 4 days. 

After about 3 days the program reports, for example

/nashome/k/kotwal/analysis/psimc/splitfiles_fermicloud737/run001/resbos_wp_8045_0.4mev_muon_004.txt file could not be opened


however the file is there

[kotwal@fermicloud737 psimc]$ ls /nashome/k/kotwal/analysis/psimc/splitfiles_fermicloud737/run001/resbos_wp_8100_0.4mev_muon_004.txt
/nashome/k/kotwal/analysis/psimc/splitfiles_fermicloud737/run001/resbos_wp_8100_0.4mev_muon_004.txt



it seems like the program loses the ability to see the file after 3 days. Is there some mechanism that does this? 

Iâ€™ve tried many different times and it is a totally reproducible problem. 

thanks,
Ashutosh
